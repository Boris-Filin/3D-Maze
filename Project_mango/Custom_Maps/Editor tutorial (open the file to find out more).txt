Hi, this is a tutorial for this simple level editor.

The compiler only takes the lines with the right syntax,
skipping everything inluding this text.

The first line it will read is the following:

s 2.0 3.0 2.0 -2.0

The compiler does not mind commas, parentheses and semicolons, so the following line is valid, too:

s (-2.0, 2.0), (-2.0, -3.0);

Now, to the meaning of that line.
In this case, "s" in the beginning indicates that it is
a segment of a straight line (which is then seen as a straight wall).
A wall is the only thing you can create for now.
The following 4 numbers are the x and z positions of two ends of the segment.

s (-2.0, 2.0), (2.0, 3.0);

This line creates a wall starting at point (-2, 2) and ending at(2, 3)
Non-integer positions are supported, too.
For example, let's create an entrance to our room that we're building:

s (-2, -3), (-0.5, -2.675);
s (2, -2), (0.5, -2.375);

Another thing you can do with this editor is change player's starting
position and rotation. 

p (0.5, -0.5);

or

p 0.5 -0.5

sets the player's starting position to 0.5 x and -0.5 z.

r 90

Rotates the camera 90 degrees counterclockwise.

That is it for the tutorial.
Now you just save your file as a .txt (that's important) in this exact folder
and it will be visible in the level selection menu inside the game!
